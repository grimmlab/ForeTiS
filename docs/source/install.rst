Installation Guide
===================
ForeTiS offers two ways of using it:

- :ref:`Docker workflow`: run the optimization pipeline with only one command in a Docker container
- :ref:`pip workflow`: use our framework as a Python library and integrate it into your pipeline

The whole framework was developed and tested using `Ubuntu 20.04 <https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/>`_. Consequently,
the subsequent guide is mainly written with regard to `Ubuntu 20.04 <https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/>`_.
The framework should work with Windows and Mac as well, but we do not officially provide support for these platforms.
If you do not work on Ubuntu, we highly recommend the :ref:`Docker workflow`.

Besides the written guides, we also provide some tutorial videos which are embedded in the subpages.
