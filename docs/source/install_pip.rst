pip workflow
===================
ForeTiS can be installed via ``pip`` and used as a common Python library.

Just install ForeTiS via ``pip``:

    .. code-block::

        pip install PACKAGENAME

Our setup is finished! Go to :ref:`HowTo: Use ForeTiS as a pip package` to see how you can now use
ForeTiS!

The pipeline was developed and tested with `Python 3.10 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3106/>`_ and
`Ubuntu 20.04 <https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/>`_.
The framework should work with Windows and Mac as well, but we do not officially provide support for these platform.
We neither officially support other Python versions, however ForeTiS might run as well.
If these requirements are not fulfilled, we recommend the :ref:`Docker workflow`.
