pip workflow
===================
ForeTiS can be installed via ``pip`` and used as a common Python library:

    .. code-block::

        pip install ForeTiS

Our setup is finished! Go to :ref:`HowTo: Use ForeTiS as a pip package` to see how you can now use ForeTiS!

The pipeline was developed and tested with `Python 3.8 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3813/>`_ and `Ubuntu 20.04 <https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/>`_.
The framework should work with Windows and Mac as well, but we do not officially provide support for these platform.
We neither officially support other Python versions, however ForeTiS should run as well for versions >= 3.8. If these requirements are not fulfilled, we recommend the :ref:`Docker workflow`.
