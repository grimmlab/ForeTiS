ForeTiS: A Forecasting Time Series framework
===================================================
ForeTiS is a Python framework that enables the rigorous training, comparison and analysis of time series forecasting for a variety of different models. 
ForeTiS includes multiple state-of-the-art prediction models or machine learning methods, respectively. 
These range from classical models, such as regularized linear regression over ensemble learners, e.g. XGBoost, to deep learning-based architectures, such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). 
To enable automatic hyperparameter optimization, we leverage state-of-the-art and efficient Bayesian optimization techniques. 
In addition, our framework is designed to allow an easy and straightforward integration of further prediction models.

For more information, installation guides, tutorials and much more, see our documentation: https://ForeTiS.readthedocs.io/

ForeTiS and its documentation is currently under construction. 
The pip-package is not yet available, but feel free to already test the Docker workflow as described in our documentation: https://ForeTiS.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html#howto-run-ForeTiS-using-docker
